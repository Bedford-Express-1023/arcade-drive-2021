this is a boilerplate program anybody can use to bring up a 4 motor drivetrain using VictorSPX or TalonSRX controllers and arcade drive

you should make sure that you double check that your CAN ids match what is listed in the phoenix tuner as part of the bring-up process

you should ALSO make sure that all your motors are going the same way, and aren't fighting one another. you can also check this using phoenix tuner as part of the bring-up process, or you can do this by commenting out lines of code one by one and testing. whichever you prefer.

if you have any questions, check with Shelby. find me at the center or ping me on basecamp :)
